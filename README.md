### Food Production Analysis of the "Who eats the food we grow?" dataset from Kaggle

#### Problem
Earth's population is growing fast. According to the dataset website the population is expected to grow from, "7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in the year 2050." There will probably be more food shortages as time goes on so we can find out what countries are eating the most and types of food over time. Through this we can possibly figure out how much food will be required in the future. This not only includes food for humans but also animals. Stakeholders would be the governments, farmers, politicians, and economists.

#### Dataset
The dataset chosen for this project is the "Who eats the food we grow?" dataset from Kaggle. The data is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The format of the data is in a CSV file. The data can be accessed from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production and then by downloading it.
